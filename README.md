## ⚙️ Customization Tips  
- **Change the message:** Edit the `.happy-christmas` div text (`Happy Christmas!`).  
- **Swap music:** Replace `hi.mp3` with any other `.mp3` file and update the `<source>` if renamed.  
- **Adjust tree colors:** Tweak CSS rules like `border-bottom` and background colors in `.tree:after`, `.tree-details:before`, `.balls`, etc.  
- **Add more trees:** Duplicate a `.christmas-tree` block inside `.trees-container`.  
- **Snow density:** Increase or decrease the loop count in the snowflake creation script (`for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++)`).

## 💡 Notes  
- Audio playback requires user interaction due to browser autoplay policies.  
- All decorations (lights, balls, star) are CSS-generated—no images needed.  
- The layout is flex-based and centers content vertically and horizontally.

---

## 🖼️ Potential Extensions  
- Add a “Send Greeting” button to share the scene via social media.  
- Make the music toggleable (play/pause) instead of hiding the button.  
- Add randomized tree colors or holiday-themed messages.  
- Add snowfall intensity control or toggle.
